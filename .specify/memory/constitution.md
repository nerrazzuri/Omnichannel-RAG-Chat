# Omnichannel Enterprise RAG Chatbot Platform Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Multi-Tenant Architecture
Every component MUST be designed with multi-tenancy as a core architectural principle. Tenant data isolation, configuration management, and resource allocation must be enforced at all system layers. No shared state between tenants is permitted except through explicitly defined and audited APIs.

**Rationale**: Enterprise customers require absolute data isolation and security. Multi-tenancy must be built-in, not bolted-on, to ensure compliance and prevent data leakage.

### II. RAG-First Knowledge Systems
All conversational AI responses MUST be grounded in verified knowledge sources using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system must maintain knowledge base integrity, support real-time knowledge updates, and provide clear attribution for all responses. Vector similarity search and semantic understanding are mandatory for knowledge retrieval.

**Rationale**: RAG ensures accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and provides verifiable responses critical for enterprise use cases involving sensitive business information.

### III. Omnichannel Integration
The platform MUST provide consistent conversational experiences across all supported channels: Web, Mobile, WhatsApp, WeChat, LINE, Telegram, Microsoft Teams, and Slack. Each channel must maintain its native interface paradigms while delivering unified conversational capabilities and maintaining conversation context across channel switches.

**Rationale**: Enterprise users expect seamless experiences regardless of communication channel. Channel-specific optimizations must not compromise the unified conversational model.

### IV. Enterprise Security & Compliance
All implementations MUST adhere to enterprise-grade security standards including end-to-end encryption, comprehensive audit logging, role-based access control (RBAC), and compliance frameworks (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA as applicable). Security considerations must drive architectural decisions, not be applied as an afterthought.

**Rationale**: Enterprise deployments handle sensitive data and must meet regulatory requirements. Security must be foundational to maintain trust and legal compliance.

### V. Scalable Architecture
The platform MUST be designed for horizontal scalability across all components. Performance characteristics must be maintained under load, with graceful degradation and auto-scaling capabilities. Database sharding, caching strategies, and microservices patterns must support enterprise-scale growth.

**Rationale**: Enterprise chatbots must handle varying loads from multiple tenants while maintaining response quality. Scalability must be built-in to accommodate business growth.

## Architecture Standards

**Technology Stack Requirements**:
- Primary Language: TypeScript/Node.js for backend services
- AI/ML Framework: Integration with enterprise-grade RAG systems (OpenAI, Azure Cognitive Services, or similar)
- Database: Multi-tenant PostgreSQL with proper isolation
- Message Queue: Redis/RabbitMQ for cross-channel message routing
- API Gateway: REST/GraphQL with comprehensive rate limiting
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 + JWT with multi-tenant support
- Monitoring: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and alerting (DataDog, New Relic, or similar)

**Performance Standards**:
- Response Time: <500ms for 95% of conversational interactions
- Availability: 99.9% uptime SLA
- Concurrent Users: Support for 10,000+ concurrent conversations per tenant
- Knowledge Base: Sub-second retrieval from knowledge bases with millions of documents

**Deployment Policies**:
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform/CloudFormation
- Containerized deployments with Kubernetes orchestration
- Multi-region deployment capability for disaster recovery
- Automated CI/CD with comprehensive testing gates

## Development Workflow

**Code Review Requirements**:
- All code changes must be reviewed by at least one senior engineer
- Security review mandatory for authentication, data access, and external integrations
- Performance impact assessment required for database and API changes
- Multi-tenant implications must be explicitly addressed in reviews

**Testing Gates**:
- Unit test coverage minimum 80% for all new code
- Integration tests mandatory for multi-tenant and cross-channel functionality
- Load testing required for performance-critical components
- Security testing including penetration testing for production releases

**Quality Gates**:
- Automated linting and formatting enforcement
- Static code analysis for security vulnerabilities
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Performance benchmarking against established baselines

## Governance

This Constitution supersedes all other development practices and architectural decisions. The platform's success depends on strict adherence to these principles, particularly around multi-tenancy, security, and scalability.

**Amendment Procedure**:
- Constitution changes require approval from the Chief AI Architect and Product Leadership
- All amendments must include a migration plan for existing implementations
- Version increments follow semantic versioning based on impact scope
- Changes must be communicated to all development teams with implementation timelines

**Compliance Review**:
- All pull requests must explicitly reference relevant constitutional principles
- Architectural decisions must justify alignment with core principles
- Regular audits ensure ongoing compliance across all components
- Use `/docs/architecture-guide.md` for detailed implementation guidance
