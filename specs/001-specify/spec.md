**Feature Branch**: `001-specify`
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "/specify"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Customer Inquiry Resolution (Priority: P1)

An external customer contacts the organization through any supported channel (WhatsApp, WeChat, LINE, Telegram, Web, Teams) seeking information or assistance with products, services, or account-related matters.

**Why this priority**: This represents the core value proposition of the platform - enabling customers to get accurate, contextual assistance across all communication channels they prefer to use.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending a customer inquiry through any single channel and verifying that the response is accurate, contextual, and sourced from verified knowledge base content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a customer sends an inquiry about product features via WhatsApp, **When** they receive a response, **Then** the response must be accurate, contextual, and include source citations from the knowledge base.
2. **Given** a customer asks about account billing via web chat, **When** they receive assistance, **Then** the response must maintain conversation context and provide step-by-step guidance.

---

### User Story 2 - Internal Staff Knowledge Access (Priority: P1)

Internal staff members (support agents, sales representatives, technical teams) need quick access to organizational knowledge, policies, procedures, and product information to serve customers effectively.

**Why this priority**: Staff efficiency and accuracy directly impact customer satisfaction and operational costs, making this equally critical as external customer service.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having an internal user query the system for policy information and verifying they receive accurate, up-to-date responses with proper access controls.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a support agent needs policy clarification, **When** they query the internal knowledge system, **Then** they must receive accurate, current policy information with source attribution.
2. **Given** a sales representative needs product specifications, **When** they search the knowledge base, **Then** they must get comprehensive, up-to-date product details organized for easy reference.

---

### User Story 3 - Multi-Channel Conversation Continuity (Priority: P2)

Users can seamlessly continue conversations across different channels while maintaining context, history, and personalized experiences.

**Why this priority**: Modern users expect seamless experiences regardless of channel switching, improving satisfaction and reducing friction in customer interactions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting a conversation on one channel (e.g., WhatsApp) and continuing it on another (e.g., web chat) while verifying that context, history, and user preferences are maintained.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a customer starts a conversation on WhatsApp, **When** they switch to web chat, **Then** the conversation history and context must be preserved across the channel transition.
2. **Given** a user has established preferences in one channel, **When** they interact via another channel, **Then** their preferences and interaction style must be consistently applied.

---

### User Story 4 - Knowledge Base Management (Priority: P2)

Administrators and knowledge managers can update, organize, and maintain the knowledge base content that powers the RAG system, ensuring information accuracy and relevance.

**Why this priority**: The quality and currency of knowledge directly impacts response accuracy and user trust in the system.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having an administrator add new knowledge content and verifying that it immediately becomes available for retrieval in customer conversations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new product information is added to the knowledge base, **When** a customer inquires about that product, **Then** the updated information must be reflected in the response.
2. **Given** knowledge content is flagged as outdated, **When** users search for that information, **Then** they must receive either updated content or clear indication that the information may be outdated.

---

### Edge Cases

- **Unsupported Language Handling**: Detect unsupported languages and respond in English with clear indication that the message was understood but responded to in English, offering escalation to human support for translation assistance
- **Message Length Limits**: Truncate extremely long messages (>4000 characters) with indication that content was shortened, provide summary of truncated content
- **RAG Retrieval Failure**: Fall back to cached responses, then offer to escalate to human support if no relevant cached information available
- **High System Load**: Implement queue-based processing with estimated wait times communicated to users, prioritize based on conversation urgency
- **External API Outages**: Use comprehensive fallback hierarchy (RAG → Cached → Human escalation → Generic error) with channel-specific offline indicators
- **Malicious Content**: Implement content filtering with automatic moderation, escalate suspicious content to human review within security protocols
- **Unauthorized Access**: Return appropriate error messages with guidance on authentication requirements, log security events for audit trails
