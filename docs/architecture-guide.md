# Omnichannel Enterprise RAG Chatbot Platform - Architecture Guide

## Overview

This architecture guide provides detailed implementation guidance for the Omnichannel Enterprise RAG Chatbot Platform, ensuring alignment with the project's constitutional principles.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Multi-Tenant Architecture

**Tenant Isolation Strategy**:
- Database-level isolation using tenant IDs in all tables
- Schema-based separation for enterprise customers requiring maximum isolation
- Row-level security policies in PostgreSQL
- Separate connection pools per tenant for resource management

**Configuration Management**:
- Tenant-specific configuration stored in encrypted key-value store
- Runtime configuration updates without service restart
- Configuration versioning for rollback capabilities

### 2. RAG-First Knowledge Systems

**Knowledge Base Architecture**:
```typescript
interface KnowledgeBase {
  tenantId: string;
  documents: Document[];
  embeddings: VectorStore;
  retrievalStrategy: RetrievalConfig;
}

interface Document {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  metadata: DocumentMetadata;
  chunks: TextChunk[];
  lastUpdated: Date;
}
```

**Vector Storage**:
- Pinecone or Weaviate for production-scale vector storage
- Local FAISS for development environments
- Hybrid search combining semantic and keyword matching

**RAG Pipeline**:
1. Query preprocessing and intent classification
2. Vector similarity search across tenant knowledge base
3. Context assembly with relevance scoring
4. Prompt engineering with retrieved context
5. LLM inference with citation tracking

### 3. Omnichannel Integration

**Channel Adapter Pattern**:
```typescript
interface ChannelAdapter {
  channel: ChannelType;
  sendMessage(message: Message): Promise<void>;
  receiveMessage(): Promise<Message>;
  maintainContext(sessionId: string): ContextManager;
}

enum ChannelType {
  WEB = 'web',
  MOBILE = 'mobile',
  WHATSAPP = 'whatsapp',
  WECHAT = 'wechat',
  LINE = 'line',
  TELEGRAM = 'telegram',
  TEAMS = 'teams',
  SLACK = 'slack'
}
```

**Message Routing**:
- Redis pub/sub for cross-channel message distribution
- Session affinity for consistent user experience
- Channel-specific message formatting and parsing

### 4. Enterprise Security & Compliance

**Authentication & Authorization**:
- OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens
- Multi-tenant RBAC implementation
- API key management for service-to-service authentication

**Data Protection**:
- End-to-end encryption for all user communications
- Data classification and handling based on sensitivity
- Automated data retention and deletion policies

**Audit & Compliance**:
- Comprehensive audit logging for all user actions
- GDPR data processing activity tracking
- SOC2 compliance monitoring and reporting

### 5. Scalable Architecture

**Microservices Design**:
```
omnichannel-rag-platform/
├── api-gateway/           # Rate limiting, routing, auth
├── conversation-service/  # Message handling, context management
├── knowledge-service/     # RAG pipeline, vector operations
├── tenant-service/        # Multi-tenant configuration
├── channel-adapters/      # Platform-specific integrations
├── analytics-service/     # Usage metrics, performance monitoring
└── notification-service/  # Alerts, system notifications
```

**Scaling Strategies**:
- Horizontal pod scaling based on CPU/memory thresholds
- Database read replicas for query distribution
- CDN integration for static assets and knowledge base content
- Auto-scaling groups across multiple availability zones

## Technology Stack

### Backend Services
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20+ with TypeScript
- **Framework**: NestJS for enterprise-grade structure
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with PgBouncer connection pooling
- **Cache**: Redis Cluster for session management and caching
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for reliable message delivery

### AI/ML Integration
- **RAG Framework**: LangChain for pipeline orchestration
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone for production, Qdrant for self-hosted
- **LLM Providers**: OpenAI GPT-4, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic Claude
- **Embedding Models**: OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002, Sentence Transformers

### Infrastructure & DevOps
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes with Helm charts
- **IaC**: Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with comprehensive testing
- **Monitoring**: DataDog for APM and infrastructure monitoring

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Workflow

**Code Organization**:
```
src/
├── common/           # Shared utilities, guards, decorators
├── modules/
│   ├── tenant/       # Multi-tenant configuration management
│   ├── knowledge/    # RAG pipeline and knowledge management
│   ├── conversation/ # Message handling and context
│   ├── channels/     # Channel-specific adapters
│   └── analytics/    # Metrics and monitoring
└── config/           # Environment-specific configurations
```

**Testing Requirements**:
- Unit tests: 80%+ coverage for all business logic
- Integration tests: Full conversation flows across channels
- Load tests: Performance validation under scale
- Security tests: Penetration testing and vulnerability scanning

### Deployment Strategy

**Environment Promotion**:
1. **Development**: Local development with shared resources
2. **Staging**: Production-like environment for integration testing
3. **Production**: Multi-region deployment with zero-downtime updates

**Rollback Strategy**:
- Database migrations with rollback capabilities
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Automated rollback procedures for failed deployments

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Response Time | <500ms p95 | End-to-end conversation latency |
| Availability | 99.9% uptime | Service health monitoring |
| Concurrent Users | 10,000+ per tenant | Load testing validation |
| Knowledge Retrieval | <100ms | Vector similarity search |
| Error Rate | <0.1% | Failed conversation handling |

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All PII encrypted at rest using AES-256
- TLS 1.3 for all data in transit
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing

### Access Control
- Principle of least privilege across all services
- Regular access review and rotation of credentials
- Multi-factor authentication for administrative access

### Compliance Monitoring
- Automated compliance checking with tools like Open Policy Agent
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
- GDPR and SOC2 compliance reporting

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics Collection
- Application performance metrics (latency, throughput, errors)
- Business metrics (conversations per tenant, user satisfaction)
- Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, disk utilization)
- Custom metrics for RAG pipeline performance

### Logging Strategy
- Structured logging with correlation IDs across services
- Centralized log aggregation with Elasticsearch
- Real-time alerting for critical issues and performance degradation

### Dashboards & Alerting
- Executive dashboards for business stakeholders
- Technical dashboards for development and operations teams
- Proactive alerting with intelligent noise reduction

This architecture guide serves as the implementation blueprint for the Omnichannel Enterprise RAG Chatbot Platform, ensuring all development activities align with the project's constitutional principles and enterprise requirements.
